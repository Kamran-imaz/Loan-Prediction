## Overview

This project implements machine learning models in PySpark to predict loan approval based on various features such as income, loan amount, credit score, and more. It demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation techniques using PySpark's MLlib.

## Features

- Data preprocessing using StringIndexer and OneHotEncoder
- Model training with Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers and Random Forest
- Evaluation of models using accuracy and F1 metrics

## Installation
-pip install pyspark
-pip install findspark
### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PySpark
- Colab Notebook (optional)
